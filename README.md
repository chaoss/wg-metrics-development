## Introduction

### Goals 

The Common Metrics Working Group focuses on defining the metrics that are used by multiple working groups or are important for community health.

### Purpose

From time to time, we come across metrics that do not cleanly fit into one of the other existing working groups. This working group acts as a central hub to create and debate over such metrics.    

### Who should join this working group?

All contributors are welcome to [participate](#participate) in the Common Metrics Working Group. The areas of interest include organizational affiliation, responsiveness, geographic coverage, and more.
