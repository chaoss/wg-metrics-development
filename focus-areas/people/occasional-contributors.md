Question: How do we understand the number of occasional contributors and the contributions that they make?

Synonyms: drive-through contributors; fly-by contributors, episodic contributors

## Description
Occasional contributors are those who make contributions to a project on an irregular basis. Occasional contributors are important to recognize in a community as their contributions can serve to advance the project in meaningful ways. One precise definition of an occasional contributor is “someone who hasn’t submitted a pull request in at least 3 months and hasn’t had more than 12 pull requests overall in the project” [1]. 

Motivations for being an occasional contributor:
- Self-service: A person has a bug they need fixed, so they submit an issue or a fix. 
- Work-related: A person works for a company and the company requires a fix or feature. 
- Special project or use case: A person needs to get their project to run on Commodore 64 or Atari 800XL.
- Documentation addition/fix: A person is fixing a typo.
- Hackathon, workshop, or other event: A person is participating in a time-boxed event for a specific purpose or goal.
- Suboptimal Onboarding: A person may have intended to stick around, but decided that the community or project was not a good fit for them.
- Life Event: A person may have intended to stick around, but may have experienced a life event that limited their participation in open source.

## Objectives
Monitoring occasional contributors can help you understand if:
- More people are looking at the project 
- More people are using the project 
- The contribution process is working well
- More people are able to contribute to the project 
- More contributors exist to convert to dependable community members 

All of which can help you improve your understanding of the health of your project.

## Implementation

### Filters
- Minimum number of contributions before someone is no longer an occasional contributor. 
- Maximum length of time between contributions before someone is no longer considered an occasional contributor 
- Percentage of overall contributors who are classified as occasional contributors
- Repeat occasional contributors
