# Occasional Contributors

**Question:** How do we understand the number of occasional contributors and the contributions that they make?

## Overview

Occasional contributors measures the number of people who make contributions to a project on an irregular basis. Occasional contributors are important to recognize in a community as their contributions can serve to advance the project in meaningful ways. They often have several reasons for being an occasional contributors, which include specific motivations, such as fixing a bug or getting their project to run on specific hardware. They might also participate in time-boxed events or simply explore the community before deciding on long-term involvement. Life events can also influence participation levels, leading to temporary or even permanent breaks. Monitoring occasional contributors can help to understand project engagement, including increased viewers, usage, and contributions. It also provides insights into the effectiveness of attracting and engaging new participants, as well as community health, diversity, and onboarding effectiveness.
