# Occasional Contributors

Question: How do we understand the number of occasional contributors and the contributions that they make?

## Description
Occasional contributors are people who make contributions to a project on an irregular basis. Occasional contributors are important to recognize in a community as their contributions can serve to advance the project in meaningful ways. One precise definition of an occasional contributor is “someone who hasn’t submitted a pull request in at least 3 months and hasn’t had more than 12 pull requests overall in the project” [1]. 

There are several  reasons for being an occasional contributor including:
- A person has a bug they need fixed
- A person works for a company and the company requires a fix or feature. 
- A person needs to get their project to run on specific hardware
- A person is fixing a typo.
- A person is participating in a time-boxed event for a specific purpose or goal.
- A person may have intended to stick around, but decided that the community or project was not a good fit for them.
- A person may have intended to stick around, but may have experienced a life event that limited their participation in open source.

## Objectives
Monitoring occasional contributors can help to understand if:
- More people are looking at the project 
- More people are using the project 
- More people are contributing to the project
- Increases in community contributions in connection with specific events 
- The contribution and onboarding process is working well
- There is an imbalance in diversity between sustained and occasional contributors 
- A community is welcoming to diverse contributors 

## Implementation

### Filters
- Minimum number of contributions before someone is no longer an occasional contributor 
- Maximum length of time between contributions before someone is no longer considered an occasional contributor 
- Percentage of overall contributors who are classified as occasional contributors
- Repeat occasional contributors
