# Organizational Diversity

**Question:** What is the organizational diversity of contributions?

## Overview
Organizational diversity refers to the variety of organizations that contribute to an open source project and how actively each organization participates. Measuring organizational diversity involves assessing the percentage of contributions from each organization within a defined period and monitoring changes in organizational composition over time.

Tracking organizational diversity informs project health and sustainability by showing the influence and investment levels of different organizations. It can indicate the project’s inclusivity, as a variety of contributing organizations may promote diverse perspectives. In contrast, a single organization's dominance might deter participation from others, potentially affecting inclusivity and innovation.

### Data Collection Strategies
**Qualitative**

* Footprint of an organization in a project or ecosystem
* Influence of an organization in a project or ecosystem
* Affiliation diversity in governance structures.

**Quantitative**

* % of commits by each organization
* % of merges/reviews from each organization
* % of any kind of contributors from each organization
* % of lines of code contributed by each organization
* % issues filed by each organization
* New Contributor Organizations - New organizations contributing to the project over time.
* Number of Contributing Organizations - Number of organizations participating in the project over time.
* [Elephant Factor](https://chaoss.community/metric-elephant-factor/) - If 50% of community members are employed by the same company, it is the elephant in the room. Formally: The minimum number of companies whose employees perform 50% of the commits
* Affiliation Diversity - Ratio of contributors from a single company over all contributors. Also described as: Maintainers from different companies. Diversity of contributor affiliation.
* In projects with the concept of code ownership, % of code owners affiliated with each organization weighed by the importance/size/LoC of the code they own and the number of co-owners.
