# Bot Activity

**Question: What is the volume of automated bot activity?**

## Overview

Bot Activity measures the level of automated activity within a project, identifying contributions from software agents rather than human contributors. A bot is a piece of software that supports project activities. Data points are calculated by the types of actions performed, the frequency of interactions, and the patterns of activity associated with bot accounts.
Bot activity helps differentiate between human and machine contributions including issue, merge request management and contributor agreements. Bots give open source software projects numerous options in deciding how to effectively manage project work. Understanding the role of automation in project workflows, community managers can ensure that human contributions are valued and recognized. Bot activity may provide additional context for: [Time to first response](https://chaoss.community/metric-time-to-first-response/), build process timing, social considerations(not just all robots), an indication of maturity, community size and project transparency.
