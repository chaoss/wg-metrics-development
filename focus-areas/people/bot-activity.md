# Bot Activity 

Question: What is the volume of automated bot activity?

## Description
A bot is a piece of software that supports project activities. Bots provide an increasingly important role in open source projects, helping coordinate open source project work. Bots support various workflows including issue and merge request management and contributor agreements. Bots give open source software projects numerous options in deciding how to effectively manage project work. 

## Objectives
Demonstrate increase in new contributors
CLA Bot activity 
Provide a filter on things like 
Time to first response 
Build process timing 
Social considerations -- it’s not just all robots 
An indication of maturity
Indication of community size 
Indication of project transparency
Understand project access and contributor privileges

## Implementation
Measurement or analysis techniques
Ratio of bot to human activity over time
Average number of bots over time 

### Filters Bots that have user profiles
Bots that require human interaction 
Bots that function by themselves (automated) 
Bots that assist with software development 
Bots that assist with communication
Bots that assist with access control
Bots that assist with inclusivity 
Platform where the bot is used (e.g., GitHub, Slack)
