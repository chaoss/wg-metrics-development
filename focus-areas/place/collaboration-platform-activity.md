# Collaboration Platform Activity

**Question:** What is the count of activities across digital collaboration platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Slack, email) used by a project?

## Overview
Open source projects use various digital communication and collaboration platforms such as email, social media, chat applications, and code management technologies like GitHub or GitLab. This metric measures the volume and location of message activity across these platforms, providing insights into where and how collaboration happens in the project.

Understanding where the community interacts helps track engagement, transparency, and project accessibility. This metric is crucial for evaluating communication processes and identifying the most effective channels for community participation.

### Objectives
The Collaboration Platform Activity metric helps:
- Understand where the community is collaborating and how it communicates.
- Identify the processes followed by each project based on communication logs.
- Demonstrate the level of transparency in project communications.
- Help contributors find the appropriate platform for making contributions and connecting with the project.
- Enable project maintainers to determine the optimal number of communication channels to efficiently share information and engage contributors.
- Identify the lowest-barrier channels for engagement.
- Support other metrics, such as [Burstiness](https://chaoss.community/?p=3447), [Project Velocity](https://chaoss.community/?p=3572), [Activity Dates and Times](https://chaoss.community/?p=3444), and [Chat Platform Inclusivity](https://chaoss.community/?p=3536).

### Data Collection Strategies
The unit of data collection is the individual activity on a platform. Metadata related to this metric can include:
- Timestamp of the activity
- Sender (user or bot)
- Threaded or non-threaded platform type
- Data collection date
- Platform message identifier

### Filters
* Number of people
* Number of messages
* Number of comments on Issues and Change Requests
* Type of channel (mailing list, irc, and so on)
* Activity per day of the week
* [Contribution attributions](https://chaoss.community/metric-contribution-attribution/) (e.g., people or organizations)
