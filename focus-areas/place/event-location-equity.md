# Event Location Equity

Question: Where are open source project events located and are the locations equitably distributed across the globe to fairly support all members of the community? 

## Description
This metric measures where project events are located globally in relation to the location of community members. Project events may include conferences, hackathons, meetups, and other synchronous get togethers. Project events may be embedded or co-located with other open source events. 

## Objectives
The purpose of this metric is to give insight about project events and meet-up locations around the globe in relation to where community members are located. This metric helps understand where events for a project are located to better understand a project’s commitment to engage a global audience. Although event organizers may not always have complete control over where events are held, this metric also helps event organizers surface potential biases toward or against certain regions. 

Certain constraints can make travel to events more difficult for global participants. Hosting an event in an area that is more easily accessible via different modes of transportation and that is mindful of visa requirements or other restrictions for international travelers ensures events hosted by a project are as inclusive and equitable as possible. Event Location and Equity may need to be weighed again [Event Location Inclusivity](https://chaoss.community/?p=4811) when planning events. Organizers can also use the [Contributor Location](https://chaoss.community/?p=3468) metric to help identify regions where community members live.

If the community hosts multiple events, this metric can also be used in aggregate, to better understand the project’s commitment to engage a global audience.

## Implementation

If events are collocated with other conferences
Geographic region location of events
The type of project event (local meetup vs. global conference)
Time window for events (e.g., one year, two years, etc.)

### Data Collection Strategies

Ask event organizers
Where are project events located?
Are multiple events being held, and if they are concentrated in one region or another?
Are the locations inclusive of community members across the globe?
Do you have a map of event locations? 
Look on project or foundation websites for event location information [1], [2]
Survey the community about event location equity. Potential survey questions for community members include:
[Survey Likert Item 1-x]  The event location corresponds with the location of community members
[Survey Likert Item 1-x] The event locations are distributed geographically to provide equitable opportunities for community members
[Survey Likert Item 1-x] The event location is easy to travel to via multiple modes of transportation
[Survey Likert Item 1-x] The event is located in a region where there are strict visa laws for international travelers
[Survey Likert Item 1-x] The event organizers assist international travelers in understanding these requirements
