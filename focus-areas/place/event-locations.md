# Event Locations

**Question:** Where are open source project events located?

## Overview

Event Locations helps understand where events for a project are located to better understand the project’s commitment to engage a global audience. Data points consist of the specific locations where events such as conferences, hackathons, meetups, or other gatherings are held.  Project events may be embedded or co-located with other open source events. Project organizers can create opportunities for participation from a wider range of contributors by actively planning events in various regions which will also create a more diverse and equitable community. Event locations provides insights into the project's commitment to global engagement and inclusivity.
