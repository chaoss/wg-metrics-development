# Event Locations

Question: Where are open source project events located?

## Description
This metric helps understand where events for a project are located to better understand the project’s commitment to engage a global audience. Project events may include conferences, hackathons, meetups, and other synchronous get togethers. Project events may be embedded or co-located with other open source events.

## Objectives
To give insight as to where project events and meet-ups are happening globally.

## Implementation

### Filters
* Virtual versus in-person or hybrid
* Attention to time zones
* Collocated with another conference
* Geographic Region
* Type of event (local meetup vs. global conference)

### Tools Providing the Metric
* Shared or publicly available calendars on project websites
* Event lists on Foundation or project websites
### Data Collection Strategies (Optional)
* Ask event organizers
* Look on project or foundation websites. For example: https://events.linuxfoundation.org/
* Aggregated Open Source event sites
* IEEE SA Open’s Community Calendar: https://saopen.ieee.org/events/
