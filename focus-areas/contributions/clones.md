# Clones

Question: How many copies of an open source project repository have been saved on a local machine?

## Description
A clone is a copy of a repository saved to a local machine.

**Note:**  Many times clone and [technical fork](https://chaoss.community/metric-technical-fork/) are used interchangeably but there is a difference between the two. A [technical fork](https://chaoss.community/metric-technical-fork/) is a copy of a repository on the same platform, whereas a clone is a copy on a local machine.

## Objectives
The objective of the Clones metric is to ascertain how many copies of a project are downloaded. Analysis of clones may provide insight into the [project's popularity](https://chaoss.community/metric-project-popularity/) and usage. 

## Implementation

### Filters 
* Time Period (e.g., clones by week, month, year)
* Partial clones (offered by [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/partial_clone.html#partial-clone))
