# Clones

**Question: How many copies of an open source project repository have been saved on a local machine?**

## Overview

Clones measures the number of times a repository is cloned, meaning downloaded and saved to a local machine. Data points include the total number of clone events, which can provide insight into the project’s reach and how widely it is being used or evaluated. Technical fork is difference from clone. A [technical fork](https://chaoss.community/metric-technical-fork/) is a copy of a repository on the same platform, whereas a clone is a copy of the project on a local machine. Clones indicate project popularity and potential user base. A higher number of clones suggests that more developers are interested in using, experimenting with, or contributing to the project, which can lead to a more vibrant and sustainable community. It also provides insights into how widely the project is being adopted outside the core development team. An increase in clones may also signal broader accessibility and interest from a more diverse range of users. This metric, If combined with other metrics, such as contributor diversity or geographic data, it can help project maintainers assess their [project's popularity](https://chaoss.community/metric-project-popularity/) and usage. This broader reach can encourage more inclusive participation in the project's growth and development.
