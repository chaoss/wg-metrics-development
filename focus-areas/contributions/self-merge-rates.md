# Self Merge Rates

Question: How many of the contributions in the project repository are being merged by the original contributor?

## Overview:

Self Merge Rate measures the number of [change requests](https://chaoss.community/?p=3610) merged by the author and merged without going through a [change request review](https://chaoss.community/?p=4712) process. Data points include the number of self-merged pull requests/merge requests compared to the total number of merged requests within a specific timeframe. Measuring this metric informs project health and sustainability by indicating the strength of the code review culture.
Healthy projects prioritize code reviews for all contributions, regardless of the contributor's experience level. Reviews reinforce the merge process, ensure code quality, and provide feedback. Self-merges should be rare and justified. Community managers track review health progress (e.g., declining self-merge rates) and review participation. OPSO managers use review health to evaluate open-source projects. Potential users and community members also use review health to assess a project's overall health and collaborative culture.
Ensuring that all contributions are reviewed, a projects will create a level playing field where all contributors, regardless of background or experience, receive feedback and support, in turn creating a more inclusive community.
