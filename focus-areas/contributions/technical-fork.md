# Technical Fork
Question: What are a number of technical forks of an open source project on code development platforms?

Context Tags: Platform, Software

Keyword Tags: Fork, Clone, Copy, Download

## Description
A technical fork is a distributed version control copy of a project. The number of technical forks indicates the number of copies of a project on the same code development platform.

**Note:**  Many times technical fork and [clones](https://chaoss.community/metric-clones/) are used interchangeably, but there is a difference between the two. A technical fork is a copy of a repository on the same platform, whereas a [clone](https://chaoss.community/metric-clones/) is a copy on a local machine.

## Objectives
The objective of the Technical Fork metric is to ascertain how many copies of a project exist on a code development platform. Analysis of technical forks may provide insight into forking intentions (different types of forks such as contributing, and non-contributing forks).

## Implementation

### Filters
* Time Period (e.g., Weekly, Monthly, Annually)  
* Ratio of contributing fork to total forks (A contributing fork is a fork that has opened a change request against the original repository.)  
* Ratio of non-contributing fork to total forks (A non-contributing fork is a fork that has never opened a change request against the original repository.)
