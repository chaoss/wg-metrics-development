# **Types of Contributions**

**Question:** What types of contributions are being made?

## **Overview**
Multiple, varied contributions make an open-source project healthy. Contributions may include writing code, managing the community, triaging bugs, evangelizing the project, supporting users, or helping in other ways.  
A variety of contribution types demonstrate that a project is mature and well-rounded with sufficient activity to support all aspects of the project, and enable paths to leadership that are supportive of various expertise beyond coding.  
Additionally, types of contributions along with project demographic information may provide insight into the diversity and inclusiveness of a project, helping inform decisions around project governance and how new contributors are welcomed.

### **Data Collection Strategies**
- **Interviews or Surveys:** Ask community members to recognize others for their contributions to identify contribution types that may have been overlooked. Example questions:
   - *Who in the project would you like to recognize for their contributions? What did they contribute?*
- **Observations:** Identify and recognize leaders in different parts of the project.
   - *What leaders are listed on the project website or in a repository?*
- **Non-code Contributions Tracking:** Use a dedicated system, e.g., an issue tracker, to log non-code contributions.
   - For example, communication channel activity like mailing list discussions can be a proxy for QA contributions.
- **Trace Data Collection:** Measure contributions through collaboration tool logs (e.g., repository commits, wiki edits, or email archives).
- **Automated Classification:** Train an AI bot to detect and classify contributions (e.g., distinguishing help requests from support provided).
