# Issue Comments

**Question:** How many issue comments were submitted during a certain period?

## Overview

This metric measures the number of comments made on issues during a given period. Issue Comments indicate the level of interaction, discussion, and work being done on a project, particularly in managing tasks, bugs, or feature requests.

Tracking issue comments can help assess project activity and progress. High numbers of issue comments may suggest an engaged community, while low numbers might indicate stagnation. For projects focused on DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), this metric may help highlight participation patterns from different contributors.
