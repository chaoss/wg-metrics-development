# Change Request Closure Ratio

**Question:**  Is the project keeping up with change requests?

## Overview

Change Request Closure Ratio evaluates if the project is handling change requests (e.g., pull requests / merge requests) in a timely fashion by measuring the ratio between the total number of change requests closed during a time period versus the total number of open change requests during that same period. A high change request closure ratio indicates that changes are addressed promptly, reducing frustration and encouraging continued participation while a low change request closure ratio indicates that the project is not keeping up with contributions and might suggest a lack of maintainers or an overburdened team, necessitating adjustments. Change Request Closure Ratio provides insight for understanding whether a project has enough maintainers to keep up with change requests, encouraging maintainers to close change requests that will not be merged, even when this might involve difficult conversations and monitoring long closure times or neglected change requests which may be a barrier to contribution for participants from underrepresented groups.
