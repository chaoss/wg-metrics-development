# Change Request Closure Ratio

Question:  Is the project keeping up with change requests?

## Description
This metric evaluates if the project is handling change requests (e.g., pull requests / merge requests) in a timely fashion by measuring the ratio between the total number of open change requests during a time period versus the total number of change requests closed in that same period.

## Objectives
Attention to the projectâ€™s Change Request Closure Ratio has numerous benefits for open source projects: contributors benefit from getting a decision about their contribution and change requests are less likely to have merge conflicts if they are dealt with more quickly. This metric also provides insight for:

- Understanding whether a project has enough maintainers to keep up with change requests.
- Encouraging maintainers to close change requests that will not be merged, even when this might involve difficult conversations.
- Monitoring long closure times or neglected change requests which may be a barrier to contribution for participants from underrepresented groups.

## Implementation

The change request closure ratio is measured by comparing the total number of open change requests during a specified time period with the number of closed change requests during the same time period. More specifically, the ratio is calculated as the number of closed change requests divided by the number of open pull requests during the same time period. Projects that are keeping up with change requests will have a ratio approaching 1, which indicates that the project is closing most or all of their open pull requests.

### Filters (optional)
* Date ranges (e.g., past 90 days, past year)
* Automated responses, e.g., only count replies from real people by filtering bots and other automated replies
* Labels
* Type of change request (bug fixes vs. new features)
* Type of close (accepted vs. rejected) 

### Visualizations (optional)

Measures efficiency closing pull requests.)
