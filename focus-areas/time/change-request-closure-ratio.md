# Change Request Closure Ratio

**Question:**  Is the project keeping up with change requests?


## Overview
TThe Change Request Closure Ratio measures the efficiency of a project in handling change requests. It is calculated by dividing the number of closed change requests by the total number of open and closed change requests during a given period. A high ratio indicates that changes are addressed promptly, which indicate  a positive contributor experience and maintaining project momentum. A low ratio might suggest insufficient maintainers, an overburdened team, or a backlog of neglected requests. This metric informs health and sustainability by revealing potential bottlenecks in the project's workflow. It helps identify areas where additional resources or process improvements are needed to ensure the project's continued viability. Additionally, a low ratio might indicate a lack of diversity and inclusion, as participants from underrepresented groups may be discouraged by long wait times or neglected requests.

### Data Collection Strategies 
- Data collection via  Augur
- Data collection via Grimorilab

### Filters (optional)
* Date ranges (e.g., past 90 days, past year)
* Automated responses, e.g., only count replies from real people by filtering bots and other automated replies
* Labels
* Type of change request (bug fixes vs. new features)
* Type of close (accepted vs. rejected) 

### Visualizations (optional)

**Total vs. Closed Pull Requests**: Data from Augur displayed using the Seaborn Python library.
