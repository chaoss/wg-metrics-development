# Change Request Closure Ratio

**Question:  Is the project keeping up with change requests?**

## Overview

Change Request Closure Ratio evaluates if the project is handling change requests (e.g., pull requests / merge requests) in a timely fashion by measuring the ratio between the total number of open change requests during a time period versus the total number of change requests closed in that same period. A high change request closure ratio indicates that changes are addressed promptly, reducing frustration and encouraging continued participation. A low change request closure ratio indicates that the project is not keeping up with contributions and might suggest a lack of maintainers or an overburdened team, necessitating adjustments.
