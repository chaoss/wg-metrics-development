# **Activity Dates and Times**

**Question:** What are the dates and timestamps of when contributor activities occur?

## **Overview**
This metric focuses on identifying the dates and times when individuals contribute to open-source projects. Analyzing timestamps of contributions can help infer activity patterns and even estimate contributors' geographic regions, especially when direct time zone data is unavailable (e.g., contributions in non-UTC). This information can offer transparency for employers about employee contributions and provide open-source project managers with insights into global engagement and when contributors are most active.

### **Data Collection Strategies**
- Timestamps from activities such as commits, issues, pull requests, and mailing list messages should be captured.
- Aggregation of data by UTC or contributors' local time can reveal activity patterns globally.
- Collaboration tools like GitHub, GitLab, and email platforms can provide timestamped activity data.
  
### **Filters**
- **By Organization:** Contributions can be filtered to focus on specific individuals affiliated with organizations.
- **Aggregation by UTC Time:** Shows global contributions and identifies project active periods.
- **Aggregation by Local Time:** Helps track when contributors contribute during their working hours or off-hours.
- **Repository ID:** Filters data by specific repositories or subprojects.
- **Community Segmentation:** Contributions can be segmented by regions or time zones, such as EU or US activities, to visualize community participation.
