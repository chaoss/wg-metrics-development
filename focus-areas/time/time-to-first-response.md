# **Time to First Response**

**Question:** How much time passes between when an activity requiring attention is created and the first response?

## **Overview**
The time to first response measures how long it takes for a project or community member to respond to an activity that requires attention, such as a pull request, issue, or email. The first response is often crucial as it signals to contributors that the community is active and engaging. A long delay in response might indicate low community engagement, while a shorter response time can encourage more participation and foster a more active community.

Measuring this metric helps to understand the responsiveness of a project’s community and its overall health. Timely responses can enhance the onboarding experience for new contributors and improve retention. Additionally, fast response times may indicate a higher level of collaboration and engagement in the project, making the project environment more inclusive and welcoming.

### **Data Collection Strategies**
- **Timestamps:** Collect timestamps for when activities (e.g., issues, pull requests, or emails) are created and when the first response is made.
- **Activity Tracking:** Use version control systems (GitHub, GitLab), mailing lists, or forums to capture activity and response times.
- **Exclusion of Automated Responses:** Make sure to exclude responses from bots or other automated systems when measuring genuine community engagement.

### **Filters**
- **Role of Responder:**  
  Filter responses based on specific roles (e.g., maintainers or regular contributors) to analyze response times from key community members.
  
- **Type of Activity:**  
  Examine response times for different activities like pull requests, issues, and email threads.

- **Time Period:**  
  Analyze response times over specific time periods (e.g., quarters or years) to understand trends.
