# Time to First Response

**Question:** How much time passes between when an activity requiring attention is created and the first response?

## Overview

The time to first response measures how long it takes for a project or community member to respond to an activity that requires attention, such as a pull request, issue, or email. The first response is often crucial as it signals to contributors that the community is active and engaging. A long delay in response might indicate low community engagement, while a shorter response time can encourage more participation and foster a more active community.

Measuring this metric helps to understand the responsiveness of a projectâ€™s community and its overall health. Timely responses can enhance the onboarding experience for new contributors and improve retention. Additionally, fast response times may indicate a higher level of collaboration and engagement in the project, making the project environment more inclusive and welcoming.

### Data Collection Strategies

*   **Timestamps:** Collect timestamps for when activities (e.g., issues, pull requests, or emails) are created and when the first response is made.
*   **Activity Tracking:** Use version control systems (GitHub, GitLab), mailing lists, or forums to capture activity and response times.
*   **Exclusion of Automated Responses:** Make sure to exclude responses from bots or other automated systems when measuring genuine community engagement.

### Filters

*   Role of responder, e.g., only count maintainer responses
*   Automated responses, e.g., only count replies from real people by filtering bots and other automated replies
*   Type of Activity, e.g., issues (see metric [Issue Response Time](https://chaoss.community/metric-issue-response-time/), emails, chat, change requests
