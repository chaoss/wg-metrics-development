# Change Request Review Duration

## Question: How long does it take a [change request](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/main/focus-areas/code-development-process-quality/change-requests.md) reviewer to review a specific change request?

## Overview

Change Request Review Duration measures the average time between a change request submission [review cycle](https://chaoss.community/metric-review-cycle-duration-within-a-change-request) and the time for a first review. This metric measures one review, however, there may be multiple reviews within a [Review Cycle Duration within a Change Request](https://chaoss.community/metric-review-cycle-duration-within-a-change-request) and this measures the time of each review.  The time waiting for a review is zero if the change request is merged without any requested revisions or clarification. Low change request review duration indicates an active community with engaged reviewers, timely feedback for improving code quality and faster project progress. High change request review duration may signal overburdened reviewers, lack of expertise, or hesitation to approve changes which can lead to contributors' frustrations or increased technical debt. Analyzing change request review duration across different contributors can reveal disparities in review times, maintainer workload adequacy and potential for burnout, whether delays are the responsibility of a reviewer, and discrepancies in review times for different contributors to indicate whether the review process is inclusive.
