# Change Request Review Duration

**Question:** How long does it take a [change request](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/main/focus-areas/code-development-process-quality/change-requests.md) reviewer to review a specific change request?

## Overview
The Change Request Review Duration metric measures the average time between a change request submission [review cycle](https://chaoss.community/metric-review-cycle-duration-within-a-change-request/) and the time for a first review. This metric measures one review, however, there may be multiple reviews within a [Review Cycle Duration within a Change Request](https://chaoss.community/metric-review-cycle-duration-within-a-change-request/) and this measures the time of each review. Low change request review duration indicates an active community with engaged reviewers, timely feedback for improving code quality and faster project progress. High change request review duration may signal overburdened reviewers, lack of expertise, or hesitation to approve changes which can lead to contributors' frustrations or increased technical debt.Analyzing change request review duration across different contributors can reveal disparities in review times, potentially indicating unconscious bias, accessibility issues, etc. Communities can then take steps to address and create a more inclusive environment.
