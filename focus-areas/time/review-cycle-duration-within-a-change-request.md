# Review Cycle Duration within a Change Request

Question: What is the duration of a review cycle within a single change request?

## Description

A change request is based on one or more review cycles. Within a review cycle, one or more reviewers can provide feedback on a proposed contribution. The duration of a review cycle, or the time between each new iteration of the contribution, is the basis of this metric.

## Objectives

This metric provides maintainers with insight on:
Code review process decay, as there are more iterations and review cycle durations increase.
Process bottlenecks resulting in long code review iterations.
Abandoned or semi-abandoned processes in the review cycles, where either the maintainer or the submitter is slow in responding.
Characteristics of reviews that have different cyclic pattern lengths.

## Implementation

Review Cycle Duration is measured as the time length of one review cycle within a single change request.
The duration can be calculated between:
- The moment when each review cycle begins, defined as the point in time when a change request is submitted or updated.
- The moment when each review cycle ends, either because the change request was updated and needs a new review or because it was accepted or rejected.

### Filter

Average or Median Duration, optionally filtered or grouped by:
- Number of people involved in review
- Number of comments in review
- Edits made to a change request
- Project or program
- Organization making the change request
- Time the change request was submitted
- Developers who contributed to a change request
- Change request
- Number of review cycle on a change request (e.g., filter by first, second, â€¦  round)
